# Implementation Recommendations for Altivento Website

## Technical Approach

### 1. Start with a Solid Foundation
- Begin with implementing the design system and core UI components
- Create a component playground/storybook for developers to reference
- Establish coding standards, naming conventions, and folder structure early
- Set up robust TypeScript types and validation for all data models

### 2. Adopt a Hybrid Rendering Strategy
- Leverage Next.js App Router for a clear organization of routes and layouts
- Use Static Site Generation (SSG) as the default for most content pages
- Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for semi-dynamic content that updates periodically
- Reserve client-side interactivity only for truly interactive elements (filters, calculators, forms)

### 3. Optimize for Performance from Day One
- Implement a rigorous image optimization workflow
- Set up performance monitoring and budgets from the beginning
- Establish patterns for code splitting and lazy loading
- Design components with progressive enhancement in mind

### 4. Streamline Content Management
- Create well-documented schemas for all content types
- Implement robust content validation at build time
- Design content update workflows that are developer-friendly
- Prepare for potential future migration to a headless CMS if content needs become more complex

## Development Process

### 1. Phased Implementation with Clear Milestones
- Follow the proposed three-phase approach (Foundation, Expansion, Refinement)
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each feature
- Establish regular demo sessions with stakeholders
- Maintain a living documentation of implemented components and patterns

### 2. Test-Driven Development
- Implement unit tests for all utility functions and data transformations
- Create integration tests for key user flows
- Set up visual regression testing for UI components
- Establish end-to-end tests for critical conversion paths

### 3. Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Implement automated checks for TypeScript errors, linting, and tests
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests
- Configure automated performance and accessibility audits
- Establish a clear branching strategy and release process

### 4. Iterative Development and Feedback
- Get early feedback on core components and layouts
- Conduct usability testing with representatives from each persona group
- Iterate based on feedback before completing each phase
- Measure performance metrics and user behavior analytics regularly

## Specific Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (8 weeks)
- **Week 1-2**: Focus on design system implementation and core components
- **Week 3-4**: Prioritize the home page and navigation system
- **Week 5-6**: Implement the product catalog structure and first category (Carpas)
- **Week 7-8**: Complete essential pages (About, Contact) and SEO foundation

### Phase 2: Expansion (6 weeks)
- **Week 1-2**: Implement wedding packages and budget calculator
- **Week 3-4**: Build out the gallery system with advanced filtering
- **Week 5-6**: Complete remaining product categories and FAQ section

### Phase 3: Refinement (6 weeks)
- **Week 1-2**: Implement the blog system for content marketing
- **Week 3-4**: Add multilingual support and CRM integration
- **Week 5-6**: Finalize all features, conduct comprehensive testing, and prepare documentation

## Technical Considerations for Key Features

### 1. Product Catalog
- Implement filtering with URL-based state for shareability and SEO
- Create a flexible grid system that adapts to different device sizes
- Design product cards with a consistent information hierarchy
- Plan for dynamic loading of product details to minimize initial page weight

### 2. Gallery System
- Implement lazy loading and image optimization as core features
- Design a modal viewer that maintains context and navigation
- Create filtering options that correspond to user mental models
- Consider implementing a lightbox effect for optimal viewing

### 3. Wedding Budget Calculator
- Design a step-by-step interface that guides users through the process
- Implement client-side calculations with server validation
- Store user selections in local storage to prevent data loss
- Create an easy path from calculation to quote request

### 4. Contact and Quote Forms
- Implement progressive form validation with clear feedback
- Design multi-step forms for complex requests
- Create automatic email notifications for staff
- Implement spam protection measures

## Long-term Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- Design the content structure to accommodate future growth
- Plan for potential integration with a more robust CMS
- Consider how the architecture might evolve if the site needs more dynamic features
- Plan for internationalization from the beginning

### 2. Maintenance
- Document all custom components and their usage
